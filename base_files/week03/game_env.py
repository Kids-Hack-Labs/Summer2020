#1. Module imports

#2. Game class creation:
#   2.1. Initializer definition:
#       2.1.1. pygame initialization
#       2.1.2. Game variables initialization
#              based on initializer function
#              (remember to create a variable to
#              control the game loop)

#   2.2. run function creation
#       2.2.1. the run() function should only
#              contain four other functions
#              (for now), three in the main loop
#              and the last one outside. The
#              functions are:
#                  process_events()
#                  update()
#                  render()
#              cleanup()
        
#   2.3. process_events function creation
#       2.3.1. This function should contain all
#              the event management functionality,
#              including polling the event queue
#              for quit-type events, and flagging
#              the game class accordingly
    
#   2.4. update function creation
#       2.4.1. This function should take care of 
#              managing the state updates, based on
#              the events handled in process_events()
        
#   2.5. render function creation
#       2.5.1. This function should take care of 
#              passing things to the display, as well
#              swapping the display buffers.
#              optional: before swapping displays,
#              fill the screen with your favourite colour
        
#   2.6. cleanup function creation
#       2.6.1. This function should take care of 
#              de-initializing pygame and exiting
#              to the operating system
