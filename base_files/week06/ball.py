#TODO: Create Ball class
#Remember:
#initializer, update and render functions are declared,
# but they lack a body
#ATTENTION:
#While copying and pasting code from last week's screen
#is good, it will require realizing which parts work and
#which don't. Remember to read your code carefully and
#check for undefined variables.
