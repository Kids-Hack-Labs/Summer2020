    Summer 2020, Week 1
    Python and pygame review
    Task: create a pygame window from scratch,
          using the instructions below
'''
#1. Modules to import: pygame and sys

#2. Create an application main entry point
    
#3. Initialize pygame

#4. Create a square window with side of 600
#   4.1. Store the returned surface from the step above
#        in a variable

#5. Set the window's title to "Week 1"
    
#6. Create an infinite while-loop
#   (While the aforementioned loop is running:)
#   6.1. Iterate through pygame's event queue
#       6.1.1. If one of these events is of type QUIT:
#           6.1.1.1. Quit pygame
#           6.1.1.2. Instruct the app to exit
                
#   6.2. Store the mouse's coordinates in a variable

#   6.3. Fill the screen with a colour of your choosing
       
#   6.4. Draw a circle on the screen that meets the following criteria:
#       6.4.1. It can be of any colour that is not that of the background
#       6.4.2. It must be centered on the mouse
#       6.4.3. It must have a radius of 50
#       6.4.4. It must have a differently-coloured outline,
#              with a thickness of 5

#   6.5. Call pygame's function that swaps the display buffers

#7. Check whether the current file is the application's entry point file
#   (if it is):
#   7.1. Call the application's entry point function

#REORGANIZE:
#R1. Look through your code, and store all numerical,
#    tuple and text data in variables.
#    Replace the hard-coded function calls with these variables

#CHALLENGE:
#C1. Alter your code so that, instead of a background colour,
#    you load a background image
#    (hint: use variables)
#C2. Alter your code so that the circle that moves with the mouse
#    is semi-transparent
#    (warning: it is not so simple as it sounds)
